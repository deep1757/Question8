# Question8
# Explanation

In the first testcase, the initial numbers are (A = 1, B = 2). There is only one turn. In this turn Alice multiplies her number by 2. Hence, we get (A = 2, B = 2). Therefore C = 2, and D = 2. max(C, D)/min(C, D) = 2/2 = 1. Hence the first output is 1.

In the second testcase, the initial numbers are (A = 3, B = 2). There three turns. In the first turn Alice multiplies her number by 2. Hence, we get (A = 6, B = 2). In the second turn Bob multiplies his number by 2. Hence, we get (A = 6, B = 4). In the third turn Alice multiplies her number by 2. Hence, we get (A = 12, B = 4). Therefore C = 12, and D = 4. max(C, D)/min(C, D) = 12/4 = 3. Hence the second output is 3.

In the third testcase, the initial numbers are (A = 3, B = 7). There two turns. In the first turn Alice multiplies her number by 2. Hence, we get (A = 6, B = 7). In the second turn Bob multiplies his number by 2. Hence, we get (A = 6, B = 14). Therefore C = 6, and D = 14. max(C, D)/min(C, D) = 14/6 = 2, because we are doing integer division. Hence the third output is 2.
